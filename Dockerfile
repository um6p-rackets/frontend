# libc6-compat is required when containerizing a Next.js application using an Alpine
# Why is it needed?
# Alpine Linux uses musl as its standard C library instead of glibc (GNU C Library), 
# which is standard on Debian/Ubuntu-based images.
# Next.js relies on certain native Node.js addons and dependencies—such as SWC 
# (the Next.js compiler), sharp (for image optimization), or ORMs like Prisma—which are
# pre-compiled for glibc. Adding libc6-compat provides a compatibility layer that allows
# these glibc-dependent binaries to run smoothly on Alpine's musl environment without 
# throwing missing library or process.dlopen execution errors.

RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat

# NODE_ENV tells your app and its tools which mode it's running in:
# usually "development" or "production".
#
# What it changes:
#   - Libraries behave differently. Express, for example, caches more and
#     hides detailed error messages in production. In development you get
#     extra warnings and debugging info.
#   - npm install behavior. With NODE_ENV=production, npm install skips
#     devDependencies (testing tools, TypeScript types, etc.), so the
#     image is smaller.
#   - Your own code can check it:
#       if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') { ... }
